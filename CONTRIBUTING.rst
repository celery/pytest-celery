 Contributing
==============

Welcome!

This document is fairly extensive and you aren't really expected
to study this in detail for small contributions;

    The most important rule is that contributing must be easy
    and that the community is friendly and not nitpicking on details,
    such as coding style.

Community Code of Conduct
=========================

The goal is to maintain a diverse community that's pleasant for everyone.
That's why we would greatly appreciate it if everyone contributing to and
interacting with the community also followed this Code of Conduct.

The Code of Conduct covers our behavior as members of the community,
in any forum, mailing list, wiki, website, Internet relay chat (IRC), public
meeting or private correspondence.

The Code of Conduct is heavily based on the `Ubuntu Code of Conduct`_, and
the `Pylons Code of Conduct`_.

Be considerate
--------------

Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the
work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and
we expect you to take those consequences into account when making decisions.
Even if it's not obvious at the time, our contributions to pytest-celery will
impact the work of others. For example, changes to code, infrastructure, policy,
documentation and translations during a release may negatively impact others' work.

Be respectful
-------------

The Celery community and its members treat one another with respect. Everyone
can make a valuable contribution to Celery. We may not always agree, but
disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all
experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration
to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community
where people feel uncomfortable or threatened isn't a productive one. We
expect members of the Celery community to be respectful when dealing with
other contributors as well as with people outside the Celery project and with
users of Celery.

Be collaborative
----------------

Collaboration is central to pytest-celery and to the larger free software community.
We should always be open to collaboration. Your work should be done
transparently and patches from pytest-celery should be given back to the community
when they're made, not just when the distribution releases. If you wish
to work on new code for existing upstream projects, at least keep those
projects informed of your ideas and progress. It many not be possible to
get consensus from upstream, or even from your colleagues about the correct
implementation for an idea, so don't feel obliged to have that agreement
before you begin, but at least keep the outside world informed of your work,
and publish your work in a way that allows outsiders to test, discuss, and
contribute to your efforts.

When you disagree, consult others
---------------------------------

Disagreements, both political and technical, happen all the time and
the Celery community is no exception. It's important that we resolve
disagreements and differing views constructively and with the help of the
community and community process. If you really want to go a different
way, then we encourage you to make a derivative distribution or alternate
set of packages that still build on the work we've done to utilize as common
of a core as possible.

When you're unsure, ask for help
--------------------------------

Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect. Asking
questions avoids many problems down the road, and so questions are
encouraged. Those who are asked questions should be responsive and helpful.
However, when asking a question, care must be taken to do so in an appropriate
forum.

Step down considerately
-----------------------

Developers on every project come and go and Celery is no different. When you
leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do
so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should
tell people you're leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others
can pick up where you left off.

.. _git-tags:

Tags
====

- Tags are used exclusively for tagging releases. A release tag is
  named with the format ``vX.Y.Z`` -- for example ``v1.2.3``.

- Experimental releases contain an additional identifier ``vX.Y.Zid`` --
  for example ``v1.2.3rc1``.

- Experimental tags may be removed after the official release.

.. _contact_information:

Contacts
========

This is a list of people that can be contacted for questions
regarding the official git repositories, PyPI packages
Read the Docs pages.

If the issue isn't an emergency then it's better
to report an issue.
