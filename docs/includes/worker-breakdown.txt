Worker Pipeline Breakdown
=========================

.. versionadded:: 1.0.0

Each worker component is built using a pipeline of fixtures that control each layer
and is responsible for preparing the worker for the test case. Let's see how our
:ref:`built-in-worker` is built to understand each step in the pipeline.

Initialization Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The worker component is initialized using a container and a node that is responsible
for integrating the component with the test case.

The component's node creation fixture receives the worker container during its initialization.

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture
    def celery_setup_worker(
        ...
        default_worker_container: CeleryWorkerContainer,
        default_worker_app: Celery,
        ...
    ) -> CeleryTestWorker:

Container
---------

The default worker container receives its configuration from the :mod:`default worker fixtures <pytest_celery.vendors.worker.fixtures>`.
Each fixture is responsible for a different layer of the initialization procedure.

.. code-block:: python

    default_worker_container = container(
        image="{celery_base_worker_image.id}",
        environment=fxtr("default_worker_env"),
        network="{default_pytest_celery_network.name}",
        volumes={"{default_worker_volume.name}": DEFAULT_WORKER_VOLUME},
        wrapper_class=CeleryWorkerContainer,
        timeout=DEFAULT_WORKER_CONTAINER_TIMEOUT,
        command=fxtr("default_worker_command"),
    )

Image
#####

The image is built using the :ref:`built-in Dockerfile <built-in-worker>` and is provided
to the container using the following fixture.

.. code-block:: python

    celery_base_worker_image = build(
        path=WORKER_DOCKERFILE_ROOTDIR,
        tag="pytest-celery/components/worker:default",
        buildargs={
            "CELERY_VERSION": fxtr("default_worker_celery_version"),
            "CELERY_LOG_LEVEL": fxtr("default_worker_celery_log_level"),
            "CELERY_WORKER_NAME": fxtr("default_worker_celery_worker_name"),
            "CELERY_WORKER_QUEUE": fxtr("default_worker_celery_worker_queue"),
        },
    )

Environment
###########

Environment variables are provided to the worker container during initialization
using the :ref:`vendor-class`.

The worker receives the broker and result backend configurations from the environment variables
by default using the :func:`celery_worker_cluster_config <pytest_celery.fixtures.worker.celery_worker_cluster_config>` fixture,
which is initialized using :func:`celery_broker_cluster_config <pytest_celery.fixtures.broker.celery_broker_cluster_config>` and
:func:`celery_backend_cluster_config <pytest_celery.fixtures.backend.celery_backend_cluster_config>` fixtures,
to provide the worker with the broker and result backend configurations according to the configured broker and backend clusters.

Network
#######

The worker will use the default session network that will be created for each test
case to allow the worker component to communicate with the other components.

The network isolation allows multiple setups to run in parallel without interfering with each other.

Volumes
#######

The plugin provides a special volume that is designed to provide improved testing control
over the worker component initialization and functionality.

To practically install the pytest-celery plugin inside the worker component, the worker
container needs to be using the default volume.

.. code-block:: python

    default_worker_container = container(
        ...
        volumes={"{default_worker_volume.name}": DEFAULT_WORKER_VOLUME},
        ...
    )

This will use the following binding to mount the plugin volume into the worker container.

.. code-block:: python

    WORKER_VOLUME = {
        "bind": "/app",
        "mode": "rw",
    }

.. note::

    The default volume may be replaced or reconfigured if needed, by providing
    your own volume configuration dict to the worker container.

More volumes can be added to the worker container to accommodate more complex testing scenarios, or
to provide additional configuration options to the worker component. For example, the *current project*
can be added as a mounted volume alongside the default volume to provide the worker with the project
code and configuration.

.. code-block:: python

    volumes={
        "{default_worker_volume.name}": defaults.DEFAULT_WORKER_VOLUME,
        os.path.abspath(os.getcwd()): {
            "bind": "/target/path/in/worker",
            "mode": "rw",
        },
    },

Wrapper Class
#############

The ``wrapper_class`` is responsible for providing the configuration class that will be used to
initialize the worker container instance.

The ``wrapper_class`` must be a subclass of :class:`CeleryWorkerContainer <pytest_celery.vendors.worker.container.CeleryWorkerContainer>`.

See more: `Fixture wrappers <https://github.com/Jc2k/pytest-docker-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#fixture-wrappers>`_.

Timeout
#######

The timeout defines the time pytest will wait for the worker container to be ready before
raising a timeout exception.

By default, the timeout is set to accommodate parallel test runs and to provide a reasonable
time for the worker to be ready in most cases. Feel free to experiment and adjust the timeout
according to your needs, or use ``DEFAULT_WORKER_CONTAINER_TIMEOUT`` to apply the default timeout.

Command
#######

The command field allows to override the worker container ``CMD`` instruction instead of
the ``CMD`` defined in the Dockerfile using the :func:`default_worker_command <pytest_celery.vendors.worker.fixtures.default_worker_command>` fixture.

If the ``CMD`` instruction is provided in the Dockerfile, the command field can be omitted.

Configuration Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The worker uses the :func:`default_worker_initial_content <pytest_celery.vendors.worker.fixtures.default_worker_initial_content>` fixture
to provide the worker with the initial content that will be used to configure the worker component's container volume.

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture
    def default_worker_initial_content(
        ...
        default_worker_app_module: ModuleType,
        default_worker_utils_module: ModuleType,
        default_worker_tasks: set,
        default_worker_signals: set,
        default_worker_app: Celery,
        ...
    ) -> dict:

It uses the :mod:`default worker fixtures <pytest_celery.vendors.worker.fixtures>` to allow configuring every part of the volume
using the standard `pytest fixtures mechanism <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/fixtures.html#fixtures>`_ by itself
without hooking into the :func:`default_worker_initial_content <pytest_celery.vendors.worker.fixtures.default_worker_initial_content>`
fixture directly.

The volume initialization integrates into the initialization pipeline by injecting worker configurations and files
into the worker container to control the Celery app instance and provide enhanced testing capabilities.
