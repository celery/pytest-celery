Installation
============

The **pytest-celery** plugin can be easily installed via the Python Package Index (PyPI) using :command:`pip`.

Installing the pytest-celery package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the latest version of **pytest-celery**, run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install -U pytest-celery

This command installs **pytest-celery** along with its required dependencies.

This will include:

- Latest version of :pypi:`celery <celery>`.
- RabbitMQ broker via :pypi:`kombu <kombu>`, installed as a dependency of Celery.

Installing pytest-celery vendors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The plugin detects which vendor dependencies are installed in the test environment to configure
the default configurations automatically. This means that by just installing the matching dependencies,
the plugin will allow extending the default configurations, up to the supported built-in :ref:`vendors`.

.. warning::

    If you don't install any vendor (e.g. no extras and no manual installation), the plugin will result in an
    empty :ref:`setup-matrix` and might not be fully functional.

To install the vendors, you may either install all of the dependencies manually, or use the following extras:

- ``all``: Installs all vendors.
- ``redis``: Installs Redis vendor, providing **broker** and **result backend** components.
- ``memcached``: Installs Memcached vendor, providing a **result backend** component.

The following extra is installed by default:

- ``rabbitmq``: Installs RabbitMQ vendor, providing a **broker** component.

To install **pytest-celery** with the built-in :ref:`vendors`, replace ``<extra>`` with the name of the vendor.

.. code-block:: console

    pip install -U "pytest-celery[<extra>]"

RabbitMQ & Redis combo
----------------------

.. code-block:: console

    pip install -U "pytest-celery[redis]"

This will configure the plugin to generate all possible setups using only RabbitMQ and Redis vendors.

All vendors
-----------

.. code-block:: console

    pip install -U "pytest-celery[all]"

This will configure the plugin to generate all possible setups.

This approach allows you to tailor the installation to your project's specific needs by including only the necessary optional vendors.
