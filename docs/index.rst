===================================
 Official pytest plugin for Celery
===================================

Welcome to :pypi:`pytest-celery <pytest-celery>`, the official pytest plugin for Celery.

The pytest-celery plugin introduces significant enhancements with the introduction of
version >= 1.0.0, shifting towards a Docker-based approach for smoke and production-like testing.
While the `celery.contrib.pytest` API continues to support detailed integration
and unit testing, the new Docker-based methodology is tailored for testing in
environments that closely mirror production settings.

Adopting version >= 1.0.0 enriches your testing suite with these new capabilities
without affecting your existing tests, allowing for a smooth upgrade path.
The documentation here will navigate you through utilizing the Docker-based approach.
For information on the `celery.contrib.pytest` API for integration and unit testing,
please refer to the `official documentation`_.
